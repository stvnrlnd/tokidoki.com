title: 'What the TCP Protocol Is And How It Works'
subtitle: 'A clear, beginner‑friendly look at the protocol that keeps your internet data reliable and in order'
teaser: 'TCP is the protocol that makes the internet feel reliable. Learn how it establishes connections, orders packets, and retransmits lost data so your apps can send messages as if the network never drops a beat.'
