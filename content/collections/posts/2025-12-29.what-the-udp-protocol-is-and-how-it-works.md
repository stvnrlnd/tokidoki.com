title: 'What The UDP Protocol Is And How It Works'
subtitle: 'A beginner‑friendly look at the “fast but forgetful” transport protocol powering real‑time internet apps'
teaser: 'UDP is the fast, lightweight protocol behind calls, streams, and games. Learn how it skips connections and guarantees so your data can move quickly, even if a few packets go missing.'

    content:
      -
        type: text
        text: 'When an application uses UDP, it hands over data plus the destination IP and port, and UDP wraps that data into a datagram with a small header. The datagram is then passed to IP for routing across the network.​'

    content:
      -
        type: text
        text: 'The UDP header includes source port, destination port, length, and checksum.​ Each datagram is independent; the protocol does not track any “session state” between sender and receiver.​ If a datagram is lost, delayed, or arrives out of order, UDP itself will not fix it.​ Any logic for retries, ordering, or error handling must be handled by the application, not by UDP.​'
